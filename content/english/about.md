Pharma Development Data & Statistical Sciences is a department of over 1,200 data scientists at Roche. 

This website is focussed on cataloguing our collaborations that are in the public domain. All content here is also available from other disparate public sources, predominantly 
conference presentations, contributions to pan-pharma public working groups, or contributions to organisations like our public funding of the R Consortium and R/Pharma. We aim to collate them into one location in this site, to provide a clearer picture of what we have done and said in the public domain about open source collaboration in late stage drug development.

We are key enablers of PD Data Sciences @ Roche's impact by revolutionizing the way our Data Scientists generate actionable insights.
