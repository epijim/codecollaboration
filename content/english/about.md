Data Science Acceleration is a team of ~50 within Roche's Pharma's Data & Statistical Sciences that focusses on building tools alongside our 1,200 data science colleagues
to accelerate their impact on bringing the right drugs to the right patients.

This website is focussed on cataloguing our collaborations that are in the public domain. All content here is also available from other disparate sources, predominantly 
conference presentations, contributions to pan-pharma public working groups, or contributions to organisations like our public funding of the R Consortium and R/Pharma.
